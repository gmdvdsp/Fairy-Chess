# Chess With Dragon(s)
### It's like chess but better.

***What will the application do?***  

It's fairy-chess that takes place on an 10 x 8 board rather than a 8 x 8 board, sans castling, checks, or checkmates,
or promotions. These are features that will come later (I ran out of time). To win, you just have to capture the king. 
Two new pieces have been added to either side of the rooks in normal chess. Hence the titular dragons.

**A detailed list of moves**:
- Pawns can, on their first move, move two spaces forward on the same plane, or else move one space forward
  as long as both squares are empty. They capture exactly one square diagonally.


- Bishops can move any amount of squares only diagonally, as long as that diagonal is not blocked by other pieces. They
  capture the square they land on.


- Knights can move exactly two squares in any cardinal direction, and then one square orthogonally of that move. They
  can jump over pieces. They capture the square they land on.


- Rooks can move any amount of squares in a cardinal direction, as long as that file or rank is not blocked by other
  pieces. They capture the square they land on.


- Queens can move either as a bishop, or as a rook, but only as one of them per move.


- Kings can move either exactly one square cardinally or diagonally. They capture the square they land on.

- Dragons start on the left of the kingside Rook. They can move either as a knight or a bishop, but only as one of them
  per move. They capture the square they land on.


- Princesses start on the right of the queenside Rook. They can move either as a knight or a rook, but only as one of
  them per move. They capture the square they land on.


Again, there is no castling, check or checkmate. You must take the opposing king to win.

***Who will use it?***

Gamers. And people who like chess. And maybe even people who like dragons.

***Why is this project of interest to you?***

Chess is a fun game, but it is actually very lame and nerdy because it lacks any dragons. I therefore added dragons and
have thus improved the game by a factor of 35%.
